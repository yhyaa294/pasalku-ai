## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   - Run `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`

2. **Start Backend Server**
   - Run `python backend/app.py` or `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`

3. **Start Frontend Server**
   - Run `npm run dev` (should be running on port 5000 based on package.json)

4. **Test Complete Flow**
   - Test landing page navigation
   - Test login with backend API
   - Test chat functionality with AI
   - Verify JWT token handling

## 🔧 Required Setup

**Before running the demo, you need to:**

1. **Set up BytePlus API Key**
   - Replace `your-byteplus-api-key-here` in `backend/.env` with actual API key
   - Get API key from BytePlus dashboard

2. **Set up Database**
   - SQLite database will be created automatically at `./pasalku_ai.db`
   - No additional setup required for development

3. **Update CORS if needed**
   - If frontend runs on different port, update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env`

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend server starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend successfully
- [ ] Login page submits to backend API
- [ ] JWT tokens are stored and used properly
- [ ] Chat interface sends queries to backend
- [ ] AI responses are received and displayed
- [ ] Error handling works for failed requests
- [ ] Navigation links work and scroll to correct sections
- [ ] All sections are properly accessible via navigation

## 📝 Notes

- The demo should work end-to-end once BytePlus API key is configured
- Database operations are optional for demo purposes
- All authentication flows now use proper JWT tokens
- Error handling is in place for connection issues
- Navigation now works properly with smooth scrolling
